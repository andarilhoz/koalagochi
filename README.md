Koalagochi
============
An online tamagochi based on a koala intended to use as a telegram bot

To create a new bot, create a telegram bot and set the token with an env variable `BOT_TOKEN`

Alternatively you can create a file `key.json` and write your key in json format:
```js√≤n
{
    "key" : "my token"    
}
```
